# Music Now Playing
## Description
Still a WIP, but this is more or less for me to revisit C++ again, since I haven't touched
it in a while.

The end goal of this will be to use the iTunes COM Interface, obtainable on the Apple
Developer website, to fetch now playing information from iTunes, and send this information
via a HTTP request to a web server, which can parse this information and store it, with
the intention of displaying it on my profile.
